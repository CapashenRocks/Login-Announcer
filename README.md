# Login-Announcer
Upon character login the script will announce- "Local spies report that a CHARACTER_RACE CHARACTER_CLASS named CHARACATER_NAME has logged in! Intelligence indicates they are loyal to the CHARACTER_FACTION."

Race and Name are in green text, but I left the color code to say change to purple. Class and Faction are correspond to class color and faction color. Origianlly, I made the name the faction color, but thought since the faction is listed that wasn't as necessary. 

The target audience with this is a small server that enjoys immersion and potentailly role-playing or playing with a few friends as a larger server I don't think would enjoy the constant barrage of messaging.
