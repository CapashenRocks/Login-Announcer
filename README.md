# Login-Announcer LUA Script
Designed by CapashenRocks (github)/ Capashen22 (discord)

# Details
Upon character login there will be an announcement with player name, class, race, and login location. Also added a logout announcement for flavor.

Race and Name are in green text, but I left the color code to change to purple if that is desired (I liked purple, but it was harder to see than green). Class and Faction correspond to class color and faction color. 

The target audience with this is a small server that enjoys immersion and potentailly role-playing or playing with a few friends as a larger server I don't think would enjoy the constant barrage of messaging. 

# Installation
Generally, this will be put in the server's \lua_scripts folder then ether restart the server or if the server accomodates the command .reload eluna to reload the lua scripts.
